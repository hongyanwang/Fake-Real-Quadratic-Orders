This folder contains all the output data for the p-Cohen-Lenstra and the p-Ankeny-Artin-Chowla conjecture.

The folder "cohen" contains results for the p-Cohen-Lenstra heuristic with p=2,3,5,7,11 and p=101,1009. There are two compressed files 2-3-5-7-11 and 101-1009. 
After uncompressing, each one contains 4096 files. In folder 2-3-5-7-11, each file has a name fac_X_cohen.
There are five lines (corresponding to two primes respectively) in each file with each line in the form
  N1 N2
where N1 is the number of FRQO and N2 is the number of FRQO for which the odd part of the class number is one for X*2^28<|D|<(X+1)*2^28.
Same thing for the folder 101-1009.
