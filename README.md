# Fake-Real-Quadratic-Orders
Computations for the Cohen-Lenstra Heuristic and the Ankeny-Artin-Chowla conjecture on Fake Real Quadratic Orders.

The program requires Sayles's libraries liboptarith and libqform
https://github.com/maxwellsayles

The computation is based on Mosunov's data: 
class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields with fundamental discriminants up to 2^40

main.c is for the test of the Cohen-Lenstra Heuristics and the Ankeny-Artin-Chowla conjecture with a fixed prime number set.
